   <p><b>Darwizzy Donuts: Week 2</b></p>

<p><b><em>A report by Advait Sharma.</em></b></p>

<li>Ater their first week of pure masterclass within the sport, fans and players seemed elated, as though there was no other care in the world, but then - the blunder comes. Read on if you dare - it's an emotional rollercoaster.</li>

<li>Miss Iya Senusha and Mr. Naail Awais gave us their thoughts on the match,
<em>I think since we had a great run last week, and it seems that no team has the prowess to beat us - this league should be fairly easy.</em></li>

<bold><li>But boy were they wrong...</li></bold>

<li>Mr. Awais said to us,
<em>We have great trust and skill within our team, so we could beat them anyways.</em></li>

<li>But they were already disastrously wrong. 
    Warm up rolled in, and already it seemed that the team was not up to its spectacle and skill they usually radiate. They were missing passes, their stretchess and running seemed slugged - it seemed as though they were on the 9th moon yet forgor to come back.
</li>

<li>The team valiantly strode onto the pitch, their eyes fixed on the ball, the fans' eyes fixed on the players. They were to be playing against the Angry Birds. A team that lived up to its name. This was yet to be the most controversial match of the season - even the history of Tchoukeball.</li> 

<li>From the opposition, Mr. Aarokyo Gupta, a tall and radiating player pranced to the halfway line for the throw-off. From the Donuts, despite Advait's calls for putting fellow-mate, Mr. Matheesan Ravindran up - the managers and captains ruled out that Eeshan should be the skipper for the throw-off.</li>

<li>The ball took no time to find it in the hands of the players, not the Daredevils though. They found their hands in the hands of Mr. Ekam Singh Dhutti, skipper of the Angry Birds and with us sniper-like precision, found its way to the net from past the halfway line. 2 minutes before halftime, disaster struck, Mr. Kiaan Maniar was brutally tacked to the ground, into the semi-circle, with the Agnry Birds calling for a penalty - which was soon given after Mr. Maniar's injuries were tended to. This turned out to be the most controversial, as the Angry Birds took a retake - claiming that the Darwizzy Donuts had sabotaged their shots. Finally - Ekam's power bode too much for the Donuts, and the ball flew above their head, and landing on the MUGA floor - making 7-4 to the Angry Birds.</li>

<li>Upon the whistle for the half-time, we went to player: Mr. Matheesan Ravindran for his thoughts on the match.</li>

<li>Mr. Ravindran said,
<em>The start was quite rocky, but we can build on it - and increase our match win chances if we work together and focus on the targets.</em></li>


</li>As the second half commenced, performance from the Donuts looked surprisingly improved. Their passes, their shooting all was heavily targeted. In no time, the Angry Birds found their lead diminishing, reaching an awe-strucking 7-6.</li> 

<li>As the Daredevils of Darwizzy focused their razor-sharp eyes on the ball, within 10 seconds of the orange teams fifth goal, Advait Sharma scored his third goal.</li>

<li><em>It was an absolutely sensational feeling. The crowd, all fifty-thousand of them, cheering my name. But I knew I had more left in me than to take the pride.</em> Sharma told us.
Soon, the score went 7-7, with Advait scoring three more goals, and the skipper, Nash Kugarooban fixing his precision-driven eyes on the middle on the net, scoring in the last 4 seconds.</li>

<li>This was their week 1 will they do better next time? Or will it end in tragedy for the daring Darwizzy Donuts? 
Thank You. Keep Reading, Keep dreaming.</li>
